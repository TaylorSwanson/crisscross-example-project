# API instance
This is a demo API server which does not use the CrissCross API directly, but the
agent still runs locally to manage the application, perform health checks,
update the codebase, manage secrets, and other CrissCross admin actions.

## Purpose
This is useless on its own without the balance instance in this same repo and the
CrissCross host xxhost application running.

## WIP
This is a work in progress and does not function alone without the crisscross agent.
